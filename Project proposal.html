    <title> My Musical Journey </title>

        My website is going to be about my personal life and my music career. It will be an extension of my career goals and my visions for the future.

        This site will be important because it will explain my musical past, present and future. It will be a fragment of my life, in any sense that I want to share with the world. It will serve as a sneak peak of all of my musical endeavors.

        The target audience for my website will start off being my close friends and family. Eventually however, I hope to grow awareness of my art so much so that the world becomes my canvas.

        Off the top, it seems perfect to me to include a page of my musical past, another of my musical present and another of my musical future. The past will focus on what got me interested in music and the arts, the present on what I am currently wroking on, while the future will focus on my musical goals and how I plan to achieve them. Other pages may include recent life lessons that I have learned or quotes that resonate to my person. Lastly, the final page may include fun facts about my other interests ouside the world of music and entertainment.
